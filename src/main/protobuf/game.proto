/**
 * A GameMessage is the datum streamed from the Catan game server to all subscribers (genearlly players)
 * The GameMessage comes in one of two flavors. Either it is an ActionRequest or a GameEvent.
 * An ActionRequest specifies the player which should perform an action and what type of action.
 * The GameEvent reflects the result of an action taken by a player, or otherwise an update from the server to players.
 * For example, proposing a trade is a GameEvent, even though no game state has changed.
 * Similarly, notifying players the game has started or ended is a GameEvent (even though no game state has changed).
 * Further examples of "stateless" changes are turns ending or a roll on which no player picks up resources.
 * More typical of a GameEvent, is a corresponding state change. In these cases, the result field of the GameEvent will be populated.
 * In nearly all cases, the GameEvent is directly triggered by a TakeActionRequest.
